# Project-CVFS
Customised Virtual File System (CVFS)

************************   Project Overview   *************************************

This project is a custom implementation of a Virtual File System (VFS) that simulates
the core functionality of the Linux file system. It is built entirely in C, with its own custom
shell to interact with the virtual environment. The project provides a practical understanding
of system calls, file handling, memory management, and OS internals.

Technology: C Programming

* I have built a Customised Virtual File System in C that mimics the Linux File System.
It implements core system calls like open, read, write, Iseek, and delete using self-defined
data structures such as Incore Inode Table, File Table, and User File Descriptor Table.

* I also built a customised shel RS SSR hich gives a complete Linux-
like environment on any OS.

************************   Key Features   ************************************

* Custom Shell Interface

  Provides Linux-like commands for file operations (create, open, read, write,
  delete, Is, etc.).

* System Call Simulation

  Implements core Linux file system system calls (open, read, write, Iseek, close,
  rm, etc.) using C.

* File System Data Structures
  *  Incore Inode Table
  *  File Table
  *  UAREA (User Area)
  *  User File Descriptor Table
  
* Platform Independent

  Allows system-level file handling functionalities of Linux to be used on any
  operating system platform.

* Database-like Functionality

  Provides a customised database management layer with structured file
  handling.


**************************  Learning Outcomes   **********************************

* Deep understanding of Linux File System internals.
* Practical knowledge of data structures used in OS (inode, file tables, UAREA).
* Strong grasp of system programming in C.
* Hands-on with shell design & command interpreter.
* Application of low-level logic building for OS-like environments.
