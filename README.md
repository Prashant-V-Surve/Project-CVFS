# Project-CVFS
The project is a custom implementation of a Virtual File System(VFS) that stimulates the core functionality of the Linux file system. It is built entirely in c, with its own custom shell to interact with the virtual environment. The project provides a practical understanding of system calls, File handling,, memory management, and OS internals.
